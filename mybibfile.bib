  abstract = {In this study, thermodynamic, thermo-economic and life cycle assessments
	are carried out for a novel integrated solar combined cycle system
	(ISCCS). The novel cycle has been developed with the purpose of using
	parabolic trough solar cycle in an on-line conventional combined
	cycle power plant (CCPP) with the minimum modifications required
	for the primary cycle. An attempt is made to determine the components
	with the most exergy destruction and assessing the investment cost
	of each element and stream of the system. The thermodynamic analyses
	are applied to the solar field and the power plant to evaluate the
	plant performance and pinpointing the zones with the high exergy
	destruction. The results indicate that the combustion chamber, gas
	turbine, air compressor, solar collectors account for 63.71%, 13.76%,
	7.26% and 3.1% of the plant total exergy destruction, respectively.
	The life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed for the system, and
	a comparison is made between different methods of energy generation
	in the proposed ISCC. The results have indicated that the energy
	generation in the solar plant of ISCC has a lower environmental impact
	in human health and resources damage categories; while, the power
	production in the natural CCPP has less impact in ecosystem damage
	category.},

  abstract = {A great interest has recently arisen for the sustainable supply of
	energy and fresh water, due to the growing demand from developing
	countries. Facing this demand by traditional technologies implies
	evident risks related with the high cost of fossil fuels and their
	environmental impact. Then, alternative solutions based on the use
	of renewable sources and innovative technologies must be considered.
	In this paper a renewable polygeneration system is examined, which
	includes a solar field based on parabolic trough photovoltaic/thermal
	collectors, a biomass heater, an absorption chiller and a Multiple
	Effect Distillation desalination unit. Plant operation under dynamic
	conditions has been analysed in previous papers; in this paper an
	exergetic and exergoeconomic analysis is carried out. The exergetic
	analysis is intended to identify the steps that mostly affect the
	overall plant exergy efficiency, so as to propose possible improvements.
	The exergoeconomic cost accounting is aimed at assigning a monetary
	value to each energy or material flow, thus providing a rational
	basis for price assignment. Both the exergetic and exergoeconomic
	analyses are applied to integral values of energy flows, comparing
	the results obtained in the summer and winter season. Finally, economic
	viability of the system in different context scenarios is discussed.},

	unit exergy cost occurs in the first separation process while the
	multi-stage CO2 compressor contributes to the minimum unit exergy
	cost. In two flash separation processes, unit exergy costs for the
	flash separator and multi-stream heat exchanger are identical but
	their unit thermoeconomic costs are different once monetary cost
	for each device is considered. For cost inefficiency occurring in
	CPU, it mainly derives from large exergy costs and thermoeconomic
	costs in the flash separation and mixing processes. When compared
	with an unoptimized CPU, thermoeconomic performance for the optimized
	CPU is enhanced and the maximum reduction of 5.18% for thermoeconomic
	cost is attained. To achieve cost effective operation, measures should
	be taken to improve operations of the flash separation and mixing

  abstract = {Faults and malfunctions occurring in engineering systems may cause
	additional resources consumptions and economic expenditures, thus
	their detection and isolation is of great practical significance.
	The procedure to discover faults is known as diagnosis, and it can
	be based on different techniques, depending on the purpose of the
	analysis: to predict the failure time of the component, or to quantify
	the inefficiencies of the system due to the anomaly. Among the existing
	approaches adopted to diagnose the energy systems, Thermoeconomic
	diagnosis provides useful information to detect the anomalies and
	to quantify its negative impacts. However, this method does not allow
	to identify possible strategies useful to reduce the inefficiencies
	caused by anomalies, which could be a crucial need for the system
	operator. To face this issue, this article proposes a method to perform
	Thermoeconomic diagnosis of energy systems that enables the analyst
	to understand the interdependencies between the components, and decomposing
	the main indicator resulting from Thermoeconomic diagnosis, known
	as malfunction. The method provides useful information for the system
	operators to define practical strategies to reduce the negative effects
	of malfunctions. This approach is also formalized and applied to
	the CGAM benchmark to highlight the practical achievements of this
	approach with numerical values. It is found that the proposed approach
	provides useful insight about the effects of malfunctions, and it
	may be helpful for system operators to reduce the negative impacts
	of the anomaly by pinpointing the component with higher contribution
	in total inefficiency of the system. In this specific case, proper
	intervention on the pinpointed component mitigated the total inefficiency
	of the system by almost 40%, and recovered the reference efficiency
	of the system.},

	abstract = {In a European context characterized by growing need for operational flexibility across the electricity sector, the combined cycle power plants are increasingly subjected to cyclic operation. These new operation profiles cause an increase of production costs and decrease of revenues, which undermines the competitiveness of the combined cycles. Power plant operators need tools to predict the effect of off-design operation and control mechanisms on the performance of the power plant. Traditional Thermodynamic or Thermoeconomic models may be unpractical for the operators, due to their complexity and the computational effort they require. This study proposes a Thermoeconomic InputâOutput Analysis model for the on- and off-design performance prediction of energy systems, and applies it to La Casella Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) power plant, in Italy. It represents a stand-alone, reduced order model, where the cost structure of the plant products and the Thermoeconomic performance indicators are derived for on- and off-design conditions as functions of the load and of different control mechanisms, independently from the Thermodynamic model. The results of the application show that the Thermoeconomic InputâOutput Analysis model is a suitable tool for power plant operators, able to derive the same information coming from traditional Thermoeconomic Analysis with reduced complexity and computational effort.},

  abstract = {An exergy cost assessment of integrated solar multi-generation schemes,
	which includes cogeneration, trigeneration, and polygeneration schemes,
	for the joint production of electricity, fresh water, cooling, and
	process heat, is carried out. This evaluation process allows finding
	out the key equipment to improve the design, detect potential energy
	savings, and establish the best configurations of these schemes,
	in terms of unit exergy cost, total exergy cost, and exergy efficiency.
	The methodology includes modelling and evaluating the performance
	of solar multi-generation schemes and stand-alone systems, by applying
	the symbolic exergoeconomic methodology. The solar multi-generation
	schemes consider a concentrated solar power as the prime mover, which
	is coupled to a multi-effect distillation, an absorption refrigeration,
	and a process heat plant. Twenty-one configurations were investigated,
	twenty of them regarding solar multi-generation plants: eight of
	cogeneration, eight of trigeneration, four polygeneration schemes,
	and the other one considering stand-alone systems. This study reveals
	that the recommended configurations for the solar multigeneration
	schemes are those in which the desalination plant replaces the condenser
	of the power cycle, and the refrigeration plant, as well as the process
	heat module are coupled to turbine extractions. Furthermore, the
	main components contributing to the cost formation of electricity
	are, in this order, solar collectors, evaporator, and reheater. In
	the case of by-products generated, the main components are dissipative
	systems, solar collectors, and productive subsystems (multi-effect
	distillation, refrigeration, and process heat plants). In consequence,
	they constitute the key equipment that could be improved. Finally,
	solar multi-generation schemes are more cost effective than stand-alone
	systems. For instance, the best option within the polygeneration
	schemes analyzed allowed reducing the unit exergy cost about 6.8%,
	59.2%, 45.6%, and 32.2% for electricity, water, cooling, and process
	heat respectively. Therefore, solar multi-generation schemes are
	identified as a promising alternative for zones with high irradiation
	conditions and scarcity of water, where the CSP technology can be
	the prime mover.},
